python scripts for drawing experiment figures.

The scripts have been tested in the following environments:
```
macOS Mojave (10.14)
Ubuntu 16.04
```
`python3` is preferred. However, you may also use `python2.7` to run the scripts.

If there's any problem (e.g., font) when running the scripts, please upgrade `matplotlib` to the latest version. Any comments are welcome.
